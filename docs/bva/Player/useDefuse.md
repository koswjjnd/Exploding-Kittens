# BVA Analysis for Player

## Method 1: `public boolean useDefuse()`

### Step 1-3 Results

|        | Input               | Output                                         |
| ------ | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Step 1 | No input parameters | boolean (whether defuse was successfully used) |
| Step 2 | No input parameters | boolean                                        |
| Step 3 | No input parameters | Output boundaries: true, false                 |

### Step 4:

##### Strategy: each-choice (since there's no input parameter, we'll test different hand scenarios)

|             | System under test                        | Expected output | Implemented? |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------ |
| Test Case 1 | Player with no defuse card               | false           | No           |
| Test Case 2 | Player with one defuse card              | true            | No           |
| Test Case 3 | Player with multiple defuse cards        | true            | No           |
| Test Case 4 | Player with only non-defuse cards        | false           | No           |
| Test Case 5 | Player with mixed cards including defuse | true            | No           |

## Recall the 4 steps of BVA

### Step 1: Describe the input and output in terms of the domain.

- Input: No input parameters required
- Output: boolean indicating if defuse card was successfully used
- Domain: Attempts to use a defuse card from player's hand, removing it if successful

### Step 2: Choose the data type for the input and the output from the BVA Catalog.

- Input: No input parameters
- Output: boolean
- Internal state: List<Card> (player's hand)

### Step 3: Select concrete values along the edges for the input and the output.

- Output boundaries:
  - true (successfully used defuse card)
  - false (failed to use defuse card)
- Hand state boundaries:
  - Empty hand
  - Single defuse card
  - Multiple defuse cards
  - Only non-defuse cards
  - Mixed cards with defuse

### Step 4: Determine the test cases using either all-combination or each-choice strategy.

- Strategy: each-choice
- Rationale: Since there are no input parameters, we focus on testing different hand scenarios
- Test cases cover:
  1. No defuse card (false)
  2. One defuse card (true)
  3. Multiple defuse cards (true)
  4. Only non-defuse cards (false)
  5. Mixed cards with defuse (true)
