### ðŸ”¥ Exploding Kittens â€“ Action Card Descriptions

| Card Name                    | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **Attack**                  | Force the next player to take two turns in a row. |
| **Favor**                   | Choose a player to give you one card of their choice. |
| **Exploding Kitten**        | If drawn, you explode and are out of the gameâ€”unless you play a Defuse. |
| **Defuse**                  | Prevent an Exploding Kitten from killing you. Put the Kitten back into the deck in a location of your choosing. |
| **Draw From the Bottom**    | Draw your next card from the bottom of the deck instead of the top. |
| **Reverse**                 | Reverse the order of play. In a 2-player game, it works like a Skip. |
| **Time Rewind**             | Swap the top 3 cards of the deck with the bottom 3 cards. |
| **See the Future**          | Privately view the top 2 cards of the draw pile. Do not rearrange. |
| **Shuffle**                 | Shuffle the draw pile thoroughly. |
| **Switch Deck by Half**     | Swap the top half and bottom half of the draw pile. |
| **Skip**                    | Immediately end your turn without drawing a card. |
| **Double Skip**             | Skip your current and next turn. |
| **Super Skip**              | Skip all remaining turns assigned to you (e.g., from an Attack card). |
| **Snatch**                  | Randomly steal 1 card from any other player's hand (including action cards or Defuse). |
| **Nope**                    | Stop any action card from being played, except for Exploding Kitten or Defuse. Can be used to "Nope a Nope". |
| **Two of the same Cat Card**     | Randomly steal 1 card from a **specific player's** hand. The target is chosen, but the card is random. |
| **Three of the same Cat Card**   | Name a specific card and a specific player. If the player has that card, they must give it to you. If not, the action fails. |

## One More Winning Condition: If one user has five same type of cat card, he directly wins the game.
